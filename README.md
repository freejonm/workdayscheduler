# Description
This is simple app that allows the user to add events to a planner. Timeblocks change color based on the current time, to indicate whether the blocks are in the past, present, or future. 

# Motivation
This app offered an opportunity to work with web APIs, AJAX, and JQuery and to practice using local storage. 

# Credits
Starter code was supplied by the Coding Bootcamp at UNC-Chapel Hill and the app relies upon the moment.js API.
